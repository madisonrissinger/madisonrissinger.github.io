        <div class="col-5"><br>I created Lifetime Tea Room based on being inclusive. <br> When I was younger the boys did their own thing and the <br>girls had tea parties. Even if boys wanted to join in on the tea <br>parties it would be frowned upon and called weak and girly. 
<br><br>
            Lifetime Tea Room was created around the fact that <br> everyone should be able to enjoy tea party food, tea drinks <br>and the atmosphere of a tea party. Boys and girls, men and <br> women should be able to come together and enjoy <br> something that was once gender specific.
            <br><br>
            Lifetime Tea Room is a tea party but the portions are <br>effecient. Tea parties are seen as small and dainty so Lifetime<br> Tea Room was created in thought of larger portions in order <br>to give a filling meal. Overall, it is meant to give a tea party<br> calm atmosphere which is meant to include everyone no<br> matter race, gender, sexuality, etc.</div>
